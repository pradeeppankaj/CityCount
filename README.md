# City Counter UI

This project is a simple web application that allows the user to enter a letter and displays the number of cities from the OpenWeatherMap API that begin with that letter.

- **Frontend:** Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** JavaScript (fetches directly from the OpenWeatherMap sample endpoint, with proxy handling for CORS)  

##  Features
- Input box that accepts a single letter (Aâ€“Z).  
- Validation to ensure only letters are entered.  
- Fetches city data from the OpenWeatherMap sample endpoint:  
https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/box/city?bbox=12,32,15,37,10&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22
- Counts and displays the number of cities starting with the entered letter.
